				<p epub:type="subtitle">The Discovery of New Zealand</p>

			<p>Now pay attention to the cause of the contention which arose between Poutini and Whaiapu, which led them to emigrate to New Zealand. For a long time they both rested in the same place, and Hine-tū-a-hōanga, to whom the stone Whaiapu<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-15" id="noteref-15" epub:type="noteref">15</a> belonged, became excessively enraged with Ngāhue, and with his stone Poutini.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-16" id="noteref-16" epub:type="noteref">16</a> At last she drove Ngāhue out and forced him to leave the place, and Ngāhue departed and went to a strange land, taking his jade stone. When Hine-tū-a-hōanga saw that he was departing with his precious stone, she followed after them, and Ngāhoe arrived at Tuhua with his stone, and Hine-tū-a-hōanga arrived and landed there at the same time with him, and began to drive him away again. Then Ngāhue went to seek a place where his jade stones might remain in peace, and he found in the sea this island Aotearoa (the northern island of New Zealand), and he thought he would land there.</p>
			<p>Then he thought again, lest he and his enemy should be too close to one another, and should quarrel again, that it would be better for him to go further off with his jade stone, a very long way off. So he carried it off with him, and they coasted along, and at length arrived at Arahura (on the west coast of the middle island), and he made that an everlasting resting place for his jade stone; then he broke off a portion of his jade stone, and took it with him and returned, and as he coasted along he at length reached Wairere (believed to be upon the east coast of the northern island), and he visited Whangaparāoa and Tauranga, and from thence he returned direct to Hawaiki, and reported that he had discovered a new country which produced the moa and jade stone in abundance. He now manufactured sharp axes from his jade stone; two axes were made from it, Tutauru and Hauhauterangi. He manufactured some portions of one piece of it into images for neck ornaments, and some portions into ear ornaments; the name of one of these ear ornaments was Kaukaumatua, which was recently in the possession of Te Heuheu, and was only lost in 1846, when he was killed with so many of his tribe by a landslip. The axe Tutauru was only lately lost by Purahokura and his brother Reretai, who were descended from Tama-ihu-toroa. When Ngāhue, returning, arrived again in Hawaiki, he found them all engaged in war, and when they heard his description of the beauty of this country of Aotea, some of them determined to come here.</p>
