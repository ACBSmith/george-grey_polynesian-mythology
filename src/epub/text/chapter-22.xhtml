			<h3 epub:type="title">The Loves of Takarangi and Rau-Mahora</h3>
			<p>There was, several generations since, a chief of the Taranaki tribe, named Rangirarunga. His pa was called Whakarewa; it was a large pa, renowned for the strength of its fortifications. This chief had a very beautiful daughter, whose name was Rau-Mahora; she was so celebrated for her beauty that the fame of it had reached all parts of these islands, and had, therefore, come to the ears of Te Rangi-apitirua, a chief of the Ngati-Awa tribes, to whom belonged the pa of Puke-ariki, on the hill where the Governor’s house stood in New Plymouth. This chief had a son named Takarangi; he was the hero of his tribe. He, too, naturally heard of the beauty of Rau-mahora; and it may be that his heart sometimes dwelt long on the thoughts of such great loveliness.</p>
			<p>Now in those days long past, there arose a war between the tribes of Te Rangi-apitirua and of the father of Rau-mahora; and the army of the Ngati-Awa tribes marched to Taranaki, to attack the pa of Rangirarunga, and the army invested that fortress, and sat before it night and day, yet they could not take it; they continued nevertheless constantly to make assaults upon it, and to attack the garrison of the fortress, so that its inhabitants became worn out from want of provisions and water, and many of them were near dying.</p>
			<p>At last the old chief of the pa, Rangirarunga, overcome by thirst, stood on the top of the defences of the pa, and cried out to the men of the enemy’s army, “I pray you to give me one drop of water.” Some of his enemies, pitying the aged man, said, “Yes;” and one ran with a calabash to bring him water. But the majority to you, ‘No dog would dare to bite this hand of mine?’ Behold the water for you⁠—for you and for that young girl.” Then they drank, both of them, and Takaranga gazed eagerly at the young girl, and she too looked eagerly at Takarangi; long time gazed they, each one at the other; and as the warriors of the army of Takarangi looked on, lo, he had climbed up and was sitting at the young maiden’s side; and they said amongst themselves, “O comrades, our lord Takarangi loves war, but one would think he likes Rau-mahora almost as well.”</p>
			<p>At last a sudden thought struck the heart of the aged chief, of the father of Rau-mahora: so he said to his daughter, “O my child, would it be pleasing to you to have this young chief for a husband?” and the young girl said, “I like him.” Then the old man consented that his daughter should be given as a bride to Takarangi, and he took her as his wife. Thence was that war brought to an end, and the army of Takarangi dispersed, and they returned each man to his own village, and they came back no more to make war against the tribes of Taranaki⁠—for ever were ended their wars against them.</p>
			<p>And the descendants of Rau-mahora dwell here in Wellington. They are Te Puni, and all his children, and his relatives. For Takarangi and Rau-mahora had a daughter named Rongougaroa, who was married to Te Whiti; and they had a son named Ani-waniwa, who married Tawhirikura; and they had a son named Rerewha-i-te-rangi, and he married Puku, who was the mother of Te Puni.</p>
