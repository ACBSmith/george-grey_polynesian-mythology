					<p>There is a beautiful poem on Rewi’s defence of Orakau in Mr. Bracken’s “Lays of the Land of the Maori and Moa.” The description of this noble defence there given is quite accurate. <a href="preface-2.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>If a child was born before its time, and thus perished without having known the joys and pleasures of life, it was carefully buried with peculiar incantations and ceremonies; because if cast into the water, or carelessly thrown aside, it became a malicious being or spirit, actuated by a peculiar antipathy to the human race, who it spitefully persecuted, from having been itself deprived of happiness which they enjoyed. All their malicious deities had an origin of this kind.<a href="chapter-2.xhtml#noteref-3" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The manapau was a species of tree peculiar to the country from whence the people came, where the priests say it was known by that name.<a href="chapter-2.xhtml#noteref-5" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>This quarrel of Maui with his brother-in-law, Irawaru, is sometimes narrated in this way:⁠—</p>
				<p>Maui and his brother-in-law had been paying a visit to the people of a village not very distant from where they lived; when they were about to return home again, Maui asked his brother-in-law to carry a little provision for them both upon their short journey, but Irawaru answered surlily, “What should I carry any provision for? Why I have just had an excellent meal.” They then started, and Maui, who was very angry, by his enchantments drew out the earth as they proceeded, so as to lengthen exceedingly the road they had to traverse; at last, being both overcome by hunger and fatigue, they sat down to rest, and Maui, who knew what his intentions were before they started, and had brought provisions with him, eat a good meal, but gave none to his brother-in-law. He then, to throw Irawaru off his guard, asked him to clean and dress his hair for him, and laid his head on his lap for that purpose; when his own was finished, he offered to do the same for Irawaru, who suspecting no harm laid his head on Maui’s lap, who threw him into an enchanted sleep, and then by his enchantments changed him into a dog.<a href="chapter-2.xhtml#noteref-6" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
